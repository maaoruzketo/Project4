        <p>The Parish of Santa María, with much property we call it "The Mother of All the Parishes of the Central
          Valley of California".



          I was curious to know as a name in English, or at least, not so Hispanic: Stockton was in an area where
          nominations predominantly exist in our language.

          Today, thanks to God, who allows intelligence to man, you can easily access numerous sources through the
          Internet . Without becoming a scholar in the matter of history, but out of pure curiosity, I consulted some
          references on Wikipedia. And I say it to open my sources that can easily be refuted and / or will be improved
          by people of much more academic authority. In all humility I just try to give an answer within our reach. But
          we assure you that I will not stay in what I found, but here the road forks; those who have more information
          from now I beg you to facilitate it to make the corresponding corrections and on the other hand I will
          continue to "investigate" and consult sources.

          I will not stop at media or sources. I will check everything that comes or goes ahead.

          Years ago and very challenging I published some notes that I will include and that will be a starting point. I
          repeat I have no titles, but I do intend to give references from the past. That past that belongs to us, that
          is ours. So ours that no one can take it from us, it remains there in the memory of our ancestors and runs as
          a source of living water through our veins. And just as we usually look for in our family ancestors, I want,
          as a member of this Parish Community, to find out how we got to where we are. And also make the recognitions
          that we have not met and that cannot be forgotten. They are our story.

          I am not sure that everyone will be interested in what I say or I will declare but I feel obliged to give my
          input. Others with expertise can order these brush strokes or scribbles. I ask God to pour blessings on those
          who are interested in knowing where we come from, to help project where we are going and how we should get
          there. Thank you.
